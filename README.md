## Skills


<summary>2021-2023</summary>

  ### 2021
  - Learned nothing actually, only Python and C. Had a girlfriend and broke up in 2021 (happy timeðŸ¥²), thus I became a programmerðŸ˜¢. Sadness pushed me all the time.
  - it's joke above, actually it due to my worst education feeling
  ### 2022
  - Started using Linux: Manjaro, BlackArch, Ubuntu, Arch (but i3), and then kept using Arch with GNOME (I love GNOME).
  - Learned crypto and web development. Was a script kiddie (still now).

  ### 2023
  - Felt like a master, learned some algorithms like Red&Black and some hard graph algorithms.


  ### 2024

- **[(Rust) Write a Kernel](https://hg.sr.ht/~polypopopo/kernel_)**
  - On sr.ht, including how I learned it.
- **[(Still Rust) Still a Kernel but a DB Kernel](https://hg.sr.ht/~polypopopo/database)**
  - Same as above, both for discovering parallel algorithms and pinning.
